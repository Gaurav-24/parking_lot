This is a car parking app which has one entry/exit and the parked car is given the nearest spot to the entry/exit.
You can select Registration Number and Color to park the car. Each parked car will be given a parking ticket. A parked car can exit the parking at any point of time and its place will become empty.

You can select Registration Number and Color to generate all the report and whichever action you choose, the results will be logged in console for that.
